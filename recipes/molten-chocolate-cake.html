    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup unsalted butter</li>
      <li>8 ounces semisweet chocolate chips, or bars, cut into bite-size chunks</li>
      <li>5 large eggs</li>
      <li>1/2 cups sugar</li>
      <li>Pinch of salt</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons flour</li>
      <li>8 extra-large paper muffin cups (or use regular paper muffin cups, which will make 12 cakes)</li>
      <li>Garnish: 1 (6 ounce) container raspberries, barely moistened and rolled in about 1/2 cup sugar right before serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Melt butter and chocolate in a medium heat-proof bowl over a saucepan of simmering water; remove from heat-proof bowl</li>
      <li>Beat eggs, sugar and salt with a hand mixer in a medium bowl until sugar dissolves.</li>
      <li>Beat egg mixture into chocolate until smooth.</li>
      <li>Beat in flour or matzo meal until just combined. (Batter can be made a day ahead; return to room temperature an hour or so before baking.)</li>
      <li>Before serving dinner, adjust oven rack to middle position; heat oven to 450 degrees. Line a standard-size muffin tin (1/2 cup capacity) with 8 extra-large muffin papers (papers should extend above cups to facilitate removal). Spray muffin papers with vegetable cooking spray. Divide batter among muffin cups.</li>
      <li>Bake until batter puffs but center is not set, 8 to 10 minutes. Carefully lift cakes from tin and set on a work surface. Pull papers away from cakes and transfer cakes to dessert plates.</li>
      <li>Top each with sugared raspberries and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
